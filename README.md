# helm-OPA-policy-testing-templates

The goal of this project is to provide a blueprint for OPA policy testing of Helm Charts using the Conftest tool.
This document outlines the process for implementing OPA-based testing using Conftest in Helm charts, including customization and configuration steps for specific needs, using a curated list of policies/rules. OPA is used here to enforce best practices, organizational security and compliance requirements.


## Introduction
Conftest is a utility that helps to write tests against structured configuration data. When used with Helm charts, Conftest allows you to enforce policies using Open Policy Agent (OPA) to ensure your Kubernetes configurations meet the required standards before deployment as well as to to enforce best practices, organizational security and compliance requirements.
Conftest uses the Rego language from [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) for writing the assertions. You can read more about Rego in [How do I write policies](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) in the Open Policy Agent documentation.

## Prerequisites
- Helm 3.x installed - https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/
- Conftest installed - https://www.conftest.dev/install/
- Familiarity with writing OPA policies in Rego - https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego
- Basic knowledge of Helm and Kubernetes

## Usage

This repository is organised in the following directories:

- `mars`: Helm chart
- `policies`: OPA policies

The idea is that you copy the policies folder into your repository and customise as appropriate.
There are three categories of policies: `deny`, `violation`, and `warn`.
Some policies have been commented out as they would not be appropriate in some cases.

### Evaluating Policies
Policies by default should be placed in a directory called policy, but this can be overridden with the --policy flag.
In the Policies directory, test files should be saved with a `.rego` filename extension.

Conftest looks for `deny`, `violation`, and `warn` rules. Rules can optionally be suffixed with an underscore and an identifier, for example `deny_myrule`.

Violation rules evaluate the same way as deny rules, except they support returning structured data errors instead of just strings.

By default, Conftest looks for rules in the main namespace, but this can be overriden with the `--namespace` flag or provided in the configuration file. To look in all namespaces, use the `--all-namespaces` flag.

### Running tests
Launch the following command from the root directory to run the policy tests against the sample Helm chart:

``helm template mars | conftest test -``

## Helper Functions in Rego Policies

Helper functions significantly enhance the readability and maintainability of our Rego policies by abstracting complex queries. Centralizing common logic in functions such as `kubernetes.known_registry`, stored in `kubernetes.rego`, allows our policies to be more streamlined and adaptable. This approach ensures that updates necessitated by changes in Kubernetes APIs or best practices can be made with minimal adjustments, maintaining consistency and reducing the risk of errors.

### Example: Ensuring Use of Known Registries

Consider a policy requirement that all container images within Kubernetes deployments must originate from trusted, known registries. Instead of embedding complex checks within each policy, we use the `kubernetes.known_registry` helper function:

```rego
# File: kubernetes.rego
# Helper function to check if a registry is known and trusted
known_registry(registry) {
  registry == "docker.io"  # Example of a known registry
  # Additional known registries can be added here
}

# File: violation.rego
# Rule to enforce the use of images from known registries
violation[msg] {
  kubernetes.is_deployment  # Ensure the resource is a Deployment
  kubernetes.containers[container]  # Iterate over each container
  registry = kubernetes.resolve_registry(container.image)  # Resolve the registry of the image
  not kubernetes.known_registry(registry)  # Check if the registry is not known
  msg := kubernetes.format(sprintf("Container '%s' in Deployment '%s' uses an untrusted image source from registry: '%s'", [container.name, kubernetes.name, registry]))
}
```

In this setup, kubernetes.resolve_registry extracts the registry part of the image path, and kubernetes.known_registry checks if this registry is in a list of approved registries. This separation of concerns makes the policies clearer and more focused on their specific rolesâ€”resolve_registry handles data extraction, while known_registry handles validation.

By structuring our Rego files this way, we can easily manage and update lists of trusted registries in one place (kubernetes.rego) without altering the enforcement logic in violation.rego. This example highlights how helper functions promote cleaner, more efficient policy management and ensure that our Kubernetes deployments adhere tobest practices and organizational standards.
